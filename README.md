# AsciiMe
A Telegram bot that listens for incoming image and translates it to an Ascii and fetch these symbols to a file. Also it creates an alias for a bash command with provided caption. This command just displays a file content. Is made for educational purposes for my kids. Only cyrillic letters are allowed.
